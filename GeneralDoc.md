## Plot

  Like I was thinking the protagonist would be a normal AP kid
And then when school ends they discover they can’t leave school
And then Theo comes and be like “yeah lmao this is actually purgatory and you have to fight your way out”
Gives you some pendant that can revive you and leaves
Because it’s purgatory everyone is like corrupted and wants to kill you for various reasons
You have to defeat them and use the pendant Theo gave to purify them cause everything Theo touches is op
Or like kill them
But if you kill them you start to corrupt yourself
The last boss you have to beat before escaping the school is your depression and anger built throughout the game
If you decided to kill everyone it’s a guaranteed game over and you turn into the schools root of all evil
If you befriended everyone you stomp your depression and find yourself waking up in AP chem
(Would be cool to tie in Divine Comedy elements into the game, idk tho I’m not Christian)
(Ok so I thought after beating the 4 horsemen you get a piece of a relic which is used to defeat the final boss. Thoughts?)

## Setting

 RHHS (duh) but arranged in [*Purgatorio*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy#Purgatorio) style, so layers and shit. Maybe make classrooms dungeon-like, or seperate things into pods, each of which is like its own dungeon.

 Layers of RHHS:

* Layer 1: Ante-purgatory (caf + gyms)

  * Encounter [Gissing](#gissing)
  * Familiarize game mechanics
  * Mobs
  * Mini-boss: [AP exams](#ap)
* Layer 2: Pride (Math Classroom)
  * Find [Choi](#choi)
  * Mobs
  * Student Boss [Kevin](#kevin)
* Layer 3: Envy (Chem lab)
  * Find [Mrs. K](#mrsk)
  * Mobs
  * Student Boss [Aryan](#aryan)
* Layer 4: Wrath (Physics room)
  * Find [Mrs. Leung](#leung)
  * Mobs
  * Student Boss [Jerry](#jerry)
* Layer 5: Sloth (Bio room)
  * Find [Hazlewood](#hazlewood)
  * Mobs
  * Student Boss [Ivy](#ivy)
* Layer 6: Greed (English classroom)
  * Find [Cimetta](#cimetta)
  * Mobs
  * Student Boss [Alicia](#alicia)
* Layer 7: Gluttony (Room 2024)
  * Find [Shim](#shim)
  * Mobs
  * Student Boss [Jennifer](#jennifer)
* Layer 8: Lust (Chem classroom)
  * Find [Spatafora](#spat)
  * Mobs
  * Student Boss [Allen]()
* Layer 9: "Earthly Paradise" (weird spce time continuum)
  * Find horsemen in order of Joon --> Sarah --> Bryan --> Sophia
  * After all 4 horsemen are defeated, you get back to Layer 1
  * Choose to either grind or go straight to the final boss

  Either the music room or the elevator will act as a fast travel.

  WILD IDEA: Can we add outside / the forest somehow?
